chemturing-scala
================

A Scala version of the ChemTuring chemical operating system simulator.

## Eclipse setup

Clone the project and run `./gradlew eclipse` to generate an Eclipse project that you can import into an existing workspace.

## Tests

To run tests, run `./gradlew test`.

## Running the Simulator

At the moment, there is no simulator, only an API for the system. The finite state machine to actually run and interact with the simulation is next on the agenda.
